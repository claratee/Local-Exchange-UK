Readme for /vendor
Clara Todd 
11 Nov 2019

This is the directory for libraries and functions that you may have sourced elsewhere.
Kept separately so that source control won't conflict with own project files.
Used by composer. 

At the moment am inlcuding the vendor files in git - but in future they should probably be added to exclude or ignore.

Example third party vendor projects

* securimage: https://www.phpcaptcha.org/.  php library for 
  captcha bot protection for public forms. enable in config with 
  RECAPTCHA_VALIDATION constant.

* form manager

* FUTURE: session handle 

* FUTURE: messaging/alerts

* FUTURE: mailers
