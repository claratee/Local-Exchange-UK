#PSEUDOANON - for testing server
#make db safe for testing. replace with your own email so you can test. 
# Use a webmail service that respects "+tag" on addresses so you can retain ref to the account. 
# This doesnt go all the way for data security, but at least makes it slightly safer. Note - first names and postcodes not changed.
